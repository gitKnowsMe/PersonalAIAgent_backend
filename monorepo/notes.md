> study and deeply understand Personal AI Agent which is our backend and Personal AI Agent_frontend which is our
     front end. We must synchronize and setup so they work in harmoney. Eventually the frontend will be 
  redeployed with vercel, while backend will stay local. That's why we should keep bothe ends separated in 
  diferent repos.  For now the front end should run on port 3000 and 
    backend on port 8000. create onother .md file and come up with a plan on how to achieve our goal.
