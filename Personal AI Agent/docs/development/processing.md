# Document Processing Pipeline

Detailed overview of how documents and emails are processed from upload to searchable content.

## Processing Overview

The Personal AI Agent employs a sophisticated multi-stage processing pipeline optimized for different content types.

## Document Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Upload and Validation
- File type verification (PDF required)
- Size limit enforcement
- Virus scanning (optional)
- User authentication check

### Stage 2: Text Extraction
- PyPDF-based text extraction
- Metadata extraction (page count, creation date)
- Structure analysis (headers, tables, formatting)

### Stage 3: Classification
- Content pattern analysis
- Document type determination
- Confidence score assignment

### Stage 4: Category-Specific Processing
- **Financial**: 500-character chunks, transaction focus
- **Long-form**: 1500-character chunks, context preservation
- **Generic**: 1000-character chunks, balanced approach

### Stage 5: Embedding Generation
- Sentence transformer model (MiniLM)
- Vector representation creation
- Normalization and optimization

### Stage 6: Storage and Indexing
- FAISS vector index creation
- Database metadata storage
- User namespace organization

## Email Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: OAuth Authentication
- Google OAuth2 flow
- Token validation and refresh
- Permission verification

### Stage 2: Email Ingestion
- Gmail API integration
- Batch fetching with rate limiting
- Thread context preservation

### Stage 3: Email Classification
- Content analysis for category determination
- Sender pattern recognition
- Subject line analysis

### Stage 4: Content Processing
- Text extraction from HTML/plain text
- Attachment processing
- Thread relationship mapping

### Stage 5: Vector Generation
- Similar to document processing
- Email-specific optimizations
- Thread-aware chunking

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Parallel processing for large batches
- Incremental processing for updates
- Cache optimization for repeated operations
- Resource monitoring and throttling

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for processing failures
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- User notification for failed processing
