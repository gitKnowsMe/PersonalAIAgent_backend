  Ensure all code written for the Personal AI Agent project is modular, secure, config-driven,
  and follows architecture-specific best practices including LangGraph, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and local-first RAG.
  Code must avoid hardcoding values, be structured for testability, and support privacy-first development.
