        "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to AI language models to generate more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. It involves crafting effective prompts that guide the model to produce desired responses.\n\nKey techniques for effective prompt engineering include:\n\n1. Clear instructions: Providing explicit, detailed directions about the task and expected output format\n2. Few-shot examples: Including demonstrations of desired input-output pairs\n3. Chain-of-thought prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning\n4. Role-based prompting: Assigning specific roles to the AI (e.g., \"You are an expert physicist\")\n5. Context enrichment: Providing relevant background information\n6. Formatting: Using structural elements like headers, bullet points, and numbered lists\n7. Temperature adjustment: Controlling randomness in the model's responses\n\nPrompt engineering is crucial for improving AI performance across various applications including content generation, summarization, translation, code writing, and creative tasks."

        "A few-shot prompt is a technique in natural language processing where you provide the AI model with a few examples of the task you want it to perform before asking it to complete a similar task. This helps guide the model's responses by demonstrating the pattern and format you expect.\n\nFor example, if you want the AI to classify text sentiment, you might provide examples like:\n- Text: \"I love this product!\" Classification: Positive\n- Text: \"This is terrible.\" Classification: Negative\n- Text: \"It's okay, but could be better.\" Classification: Neutral\n\nThen you ask: Text: \"I'm really happy with my purchase.\" Classification: ?\n\nFew-shot prompting is particularly useful when you need specific formatting in responses or when the task might be ambiguous without examples.",

        "I found relevant information in your documents, but I'm having trouble formulating a complete answer. Here's what I know: the context contains information related to your query, but I need to process it differently. Please try rephrasing your question or asking about a specific aspect of the topic.",
        "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to AI language models to generate more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. It involves crafting effective prompts that guide the model to produce desired responses.\n\nKey techniques for effective prompt engineering include:\n\n1. Clear instructions: Providing explicit, detailed directions about the task and expected output format\n2. Few-shot examples: Including demonstrations of desired input-output pairs\n3. Chain-of-thought prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning\n4. Role-based prompting: Assigning specific roles to the AI (e.g., \"You are an expert physicist\")\n5. Context enrichment: Providing relevant background information\n6. Formatting: Using structural elements like headers, bullet points, and numbered lists\n7. Temperature adjustment: Controlling randomness in the model's responses\n\nPrompt engineering is crucial for improving AI performance across various applications including content generation, summarization, translation, code writing, and creative tasks."
